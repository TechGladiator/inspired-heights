    <h3 class="main-logo">Our History</h3>

    <p>As a third generation steeplejack, Tony Stratton learned to combine the best of old fashioned craftsmanship with current technical advances. Of the various types of construction Tony experienced as a steeplejack he most enjoyed churches. The history, architecture, and artistic detail always fascinated Tony while giving him the opportunity to serve the church he loves.</p>

    <p>For this reason in 1993 Tony started his own steeplejack company that would specialize in the restoration and preservation of churches. Over the years Tony continued to expand through continual training and building of a diversified team. Originally called Tony Stratton-Steeplejack this company has grown to become Inspired Heights, Inc. a leader in church restoration.</p>
